								'React app with firebase realtime database to register orders in restaurants. It was built to solve the problem of \'Duas de Letra\' restaurant in communication between the three floors. It\'s a web app where you can take orders and change order status in real time. There are two screens, one to take orders, and another one to check orders and order status. That way cooks, production and waiters have instant communication, replacing the writing on little paper and then walkÂ to production only then to be transmitted via speakerphone to the kitchen. It can be costumized to work in different restaurants',
								'Sr. Carlos roxo is a multidisciplinary artist (also a good friend of mine) based on Torres Vedras, Portugal. It\'s a pro-bono work where I was able to develop a personalied backend and frontend for a wordpress website. Was also an oportunity for me to explore my educational past as a graphic designer, being it fully designed by me, with some finishing cooperation with Carlos Roxo herself. One of my most recents works, and by its nature, my proudest one :)'
